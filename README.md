# Module 3 Challenge - Customer Banking System

The focus of module 3 is Python code style, documentation, organization, modularization, and object oriented 
programming (OOP).

This customer banking system allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. Users 
are able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances 
after a specified number of months.

This implementation of the customer banking system incorporates the code style, documentation, organization, 
modularization, and OOP concepts learned in class. It also incorporates looping, packing, and unpacking concepts
learned in previous modules. 

## Files:

* customer_banking.py - Main application script
* cd_account.py - Defines a function for creating a CD Account
* savings_account.py - Defines a function for creating a Savings Account
* Account.py - Defines the Account class
