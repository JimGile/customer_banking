# Module 3 Challenge - Customer Banking System

The focus of module 3 is Python code style, documentation, organization, modularization, and object oriented 
programming (OOP). This implementation of the customer banking system incorporates all of those concepts plus exception handling, looping, packing, and unpacking concepts
learned in previous modules.

The system allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. Users are able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months.

It ensures that all user input is numeric and non-negative.

## Files:

* customer_banking.py - Main Customer Banking System application script
* cd_account.py - Defines a function for creating a CD Account
* savings_account.py - Defines a function for creating a Savings Account
* Account.py - Defines the Account class
